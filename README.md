## How to set custom icons on MacOS

_You must use an `.icns` file like what you see in this repository. If you want to create your own Icon files, the app I used is [Image2Icon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image2icon-make-your-icons/id992115977?mt=12) from the Apple AppStore. You just need to create your image first in the editor of your choice. PNG format works best since it supports transparency. Then you just drag your image into the app and save the `.icns` file. After that, follow the steps below._

### 1. Open the **_Get Info_** window for the drive or folder you wish to change

You can access **_Get Info_** one of three ways:
  - _right-click_ the target and select **_Get Info_**
  - click on the target to select it, and press _command + i_
  - click on the target to select it, and you will find **_Get Info_** under the _File_ menu

### 2. Drag the `.icns` file to the icon displayed at the top of the **_Get Info_** dialogue

#### To revert back to the original icon, just click on the icon in **_Get Info_** to select it, then press the `delete` or `backspace` key on your keyboard.
